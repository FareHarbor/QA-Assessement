# Solution explanation
The four requested tests can be run with following commands, specified in package.json:
- npm run test-payment
- npm run test-invoice
- npm run test-booking
- npm run test-privateTour

In order to showcase my skills and capabilities of Cypress, I have tried using as many components as possible, thus taking different approaches to some parts of test case i.e. logging to terminal in TEST1_failedPayment.cy.js where I had to play with setupNodeEvents in cypress.config.js

The taken approaches are the presentation of how I think that things should be done and how I currently do them, which, with more experience with this skill set, will most probably change in future

Thank you for your consideration. Looking forward to meeting with you!
